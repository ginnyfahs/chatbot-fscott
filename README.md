Chatbot F. Scott is a Facebook Messenger chatbot with the personality of the great American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Ask Chatbot F Scott a question, and heâ€™ll respond with an authentic and relevant F. Scott Fitzgerald quote.

Chatbot F. Scott plays with the expectations we have when we communicate with technology. How do we talk to technology? How do we expect technology to talk to us? And how can we use technology to develop a new relationship with the past?
